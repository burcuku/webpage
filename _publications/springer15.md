**Abstract.** While transactional memory has been investigated intensively, its use as a programming primitive by application and system
builders is only recently becoming widespread, especially with the availability of hardware support in mainstream commercial CPUs. One key
benefit of using transactional memory while writing applications is the
simplicity of not having to reason at a low level about synchronization.
For this to be possible, verification tools that are aware of atomic blocks
and their semantics are needed. While such tools are clearly needed for
the adoption of transactional memory in real systems, research in this
area is quite preliminary. In this chapter, we provide highlights of our
previous work on verification tools for transactional programs.
