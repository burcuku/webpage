**Abstract.** Distributed systems are very complex and in case of errors hard to debug. The high number of messages with non
deterministic delivery timings, as well as message losses,
data corruption and node crashes cannot be efficiently analyzed with traditional GUI tools. We propose to use immersive technologies in a multi-display environment to tackle
these shortcomings. Our DebugAR approach shows a representation of the current systems state, message provenance, and the lifetime of participating nodes and offers
layouting techniques. By providing a screen that shows
a traditional text-log, we bridge the gap to conventional
tools. Additionally, we propose an interactive 3D visualization of the message flow, combining an interactive tabletop
with augmented reality using a head-mounted display. We
are confident that our proposed solution can not only be
used to analyze distributed system, but also for other timedependent networks.
