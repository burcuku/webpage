I am an Assistant Professor and Delft Technology Fellow in the Software Engineering Research Group ([SERG](https://se.ewi.tudelft.nl/)) at Delft University of Technology. Before that, I was a postdoc researcher at Max Planck Institute for Software Systems in the Rigorous Software Engineering Group, working with Rupak Majumdar. I got my PhD from Ko√ß University under the supervision of Serdar Tasiran.

My research interests include software testing, debugging, and verification for concurrent programs, and distributed systems. You can visit [Reliability of Distributed Software Systems
](https://se.ewi.tudelft.nl/research-lines/reliability-distributed/) research line for more information.
